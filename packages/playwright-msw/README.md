## Features

- **Powerful**. Intercept and mock network requests that are performed by browsers during Playwright test execution.
- **Customizable**. Runs within context of an individual test, mocks can be safely manipulated on a per-test basis without interfering with others that are executing in parallel.
- **Flexible**. Like the [official MSW library](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) that runs within the browser, playwright-msw supports both REST and GraphQL.
- **Easy to implement**. No code changes are required to your app. [^implementation]

[^implementation]: If the target application is already running MSW in the browser (e.g. a local dev server), this will need to be disabled while the Playwright tests are executing. It is recommended to test against the production bundle.

## Announcement

As of version 3, `playwright-msw` has been updated to utilize MSW 2.x. In order to utilize the latest version of `playwright-msw`, you must update your tests to use the new syntax. Please follow MSW's amazing [Migration Guide](https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x). Apart from updating your tests to use MSW's new syntax, the API for `playwright-msw` itself remains unchanged.

If you're not ready to update your tests, please continue to use version 2.x of `playwright-msw`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

This library assumes that you have the following peer dependencies are already installed:

- [@playwright/test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/test)
- [msw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw)

### Install

To start, install the dependency using your preferred package manager:

```shell
npm install playwright-msw --save-dev
# or
yarn add playwright-msw --dev
```

### Setup

#### Create mock handlers

If you haven't already done so, [create some mock handlers](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/mocks) for API calls that your app will perform. e.g. within a [handlers.ts](https://github.com/valendres/playwright-msw/blob/main/packages/example/src/mocks/handlers.ts) file:

```typescript
import { http, delay, HttpResponse } from 'msw';

/** A collection of handlers to be used by default for all tests. */
export default [
  http.get('/api/users', async () => {
    await delay(500);
    return HttpResponse.json(
      [
        {
          id: 'bcff5c0e-10b6-407b-94d1-90d741363885',
          firstName: 'Rhydian',
          lastName: 'Greig',
        },
        {
          id: 'b44e89e4-3254-415e-b14a-441166616b20',
          firstName: 'Alessandro',
          lastName: 'Metcalfe',
        },
        {
          id: '6e369942-6b5d-4159-9b39-729646549183',
          firstName: 'Erika',
          lastName: 'Richards',
        },
      ],
      {
        status: 200,
      },
    );
  }),
];
```

#### Create a the worker fixture

The next step is to [create a custom fixture](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#creating-a-fixture) using the [createWorkerFixture](#createworkerfixture) function from `playwright-msw`. e.g. within a custom [test.ts](https://github.com/valendres/playwright-msw/blob/main/packages/example/tests/playwright/test.ts) file:

If you're using REST API's, all you need to do is provide your handlers to `createWorkerFixture`, no config object is required:

```typescript
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { http } from 'msw';
import type { MockServiceWorker } from 'playwright-msw';
import { createWorkerFixture } from 'playwright-msw';

import handlers from './handlers';

const test = base.extend<{
  worker: MockServiceWorker;
  http: typeof http;
}>({
  worker: createWorkerFixture(handlers),
  http
});

export { expect, test };
```

**Note:** if you're using GraphQL, then it is assumed that the calls are made over HTTP. The default uri for the graphql endpoint is `/graphql`. This can be customized via [configuration](#configuration) object when creating the worker.

### Use the custom test fixture

The final step is to use the extended `test` implementation within your playwright tests. e.g. within a [http.spec.ts](https://github.com/valendres/playwright-msw/blob/main/packages/example/tests/playwright/specs/http.spec.ts) file:

```typescript
import { delay, HttpResponse } from 'msw';
import { expect, test } from '../test';

test.describe.parallel("A demo of playwright-msw's functionality", () => {
  test('should use the default handlers without requiring handlers to be specified on a per-test basis', async ({
    page,
  }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await expect(page.locator('text="Alessandro Metcalfe"')).toBeVisible();
  });

  test.only('should allow mocks to be overridden on a per test basis', async ({
    page,
    worker,
    http
  }) => {
    await worker.use(
      http.get('/api/users', async () => {
        await delay(250);
        return new HttpResponse(null, {
          status: 403,
        });
      }),
    );
    await page.goto('/');
    await expect(page.locator('text="Alessandro Metcalfe"')).toBeHidden();
    await expect(page.locator('text="Failed to load users"')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

## API

### `createWorkerFixture`

The `createWorkerFixture(handlers, config)` function creates a fixture that mocks api calls on a per-test basis that is automatically started even if the test does not use it directly. The provided handlers will be used by all tests by default. The created [MockServiceWorker](#mockserviceworker) fixture can be optionally used to customise mocks on a per-test basis.

Refer to the [Getting Started: Create a the worker fixture](#create-a-the-worker-fixture) for a usage example. If this abstraction layer is over-simplified for your use case, the [createWorker](#createWorker) function can be used instead.

#### Configuration

The `createWorkerFixture` function supports an optional configuration object with the following parameters:

| key             | required | default      | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| graphqlUrl      | false    | `"/graphql"` | The URL of the GraphQL endpoint to send requests to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| waitForPageLoad | false    | `true`       | Waits for the page to load before mocking API calls. When enabled, it allows `playwright-msw` to mirror the behaviour of `msw` when it is running in the browser, where the initial static resource requests will not be mocked because `msw` will have only been initialized until after page load. |

When enabled, it allows `playwright-msw` to emulate the behavior of `msw` when running in the browser, i.e. initialize after page load |

### `createWorker`

The `createWorker(page: Page, handlers?: RequestHandler[], config?: Config)` function creates a server that intercepts and mocks API calls for an individual playwright page. It returns a [MockServiceWorker](#mockserviceworker) object which can be used for further customization.

Usage example:

```typescript
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { createWorker, MockServiceWorker } from 'playwright-msw';

import handlers from './handlers';

const test = base.extend<{
  worker: MockServiceWorker;
}>({
  worker: [
    async ({ page }, use) => {
      const server = await createWorker(page, handlers);
      // Test has not started to execute...
      await use(server);
      // Test has finished executing...
      // [insert any cleanup actions here]
    },
    {
      /**
       * Scope this fixture on a per test basis to ensure that each test has a
       * fresh copy of MSW. Note: the scope MUST be "test" to be able to use the
       * `page` fixture as it is not possible to access it when scoped to the
       * "worker".
       */
      scope: 'test',
      /**
       * By default, fixtures are lazy; they will not be initalised unless they're
       * used by the test. Setting `true` here means that the fixture will be auto-
       * initialised even if the test doesn't use it.
       */
      auto: true,
    },
  ],
});

export { test, expect };
```

### `MockServiceWorker`

The `MockServiceWorker` instance returned by [createWorker](#createworker) or exposed via [createWorkerFixture](#createworkerfixture) has a number of utility functions to facilitate additional customisations:

- `use(...customHandlers: RequestHandler[])`: Prepends given request handlers to the list of existing handlers. This is useful for overriding mocks on a per test behaviour, e.g. testing what happens if a particular API call fails.
- `resetHandlers(...customHandlers: RequestHandler[])`: Resets request handlers to the initial list given to the createWorker call, or to the explicit next request handlers list, if given.
- `resetCookieStore()`: Resets MSW's internal cookie store by removing all cookies from it. **\*Note:** this is automatically called at the end of each test.\*

## Examples

This library tests itself to make sure the integration between MSW and Playwright is working as expected. For real examples of how it can be used, please refer to:
[packages/example/README.md](../example/README.md)

## Acknowledgements

This library does not seek to steal any thunder, it merely unifies two amazing tools that have already been built:

1. [kettanaito](https://github.com/kettanaito) for creating [MSW](https://mswjs.io/)
2. [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) for creating [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

Thank you for making these tools and thank you to the numerous people who have contributed to `playwright-msw` 🙂
