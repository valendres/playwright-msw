# Contributing

PR's are welcome. The fastest way to get a change in is to make a PR. If you're not sure how to fix something, feel free to create a [New Issue](https://github.com/valendres/playwright-msw/issues/new). If you just have a question, please start a [New Discussion](https://github.com/valendres/playwright-msw/discussions/new).

## Guidelines

Given that this tool is likely utilized in CI pipelines for ensuring that a website or app is behaving as expected, is is critical that we minimise breaking changes as much as possible. Where it makes sense to do so, automation tests (Unit & Integration) and documentation should be updated.

### Testing

For a PR to be merged, tests must be written to ensure that your contribution behaves the way you expect it to behave. Your PR will not be merged until this is done and all tests are passing.

There are two kinds of tests within this repo:

1. **Unit tests:** These tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) are defined within the [playwright-msw](./packages/../README.md) package. If it makes sense to do so (e.g. logic is updated), unit tests should be included. Changes to existing tests should be avoided if possible as this could potentially constitute a breaking change.
2. **Integration tests:**

### Documentation

If you're modifying any of the consumer-facing code to the library (exposed functions, config options etc.), the [playwright-msw/README.md](./packages/playwright-msw/README.md) must be updated to reflect these changes. Your PR will not be merged until this is done.

2. Next, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your forked version of `playwright-msw`.
